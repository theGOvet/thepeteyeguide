title: Track you pet eye treatment

Keeping track of your pet’s medications—especially eye drops, tablets, or treatments given multiple times a day—can be stressful, particularly when more than one person is helping with their care. The **Meds Tracker** is a simple printable tool designed to help you stay organised and make sure no doses are missed or repeated.

You'll need a PDF viewer installed in your device, a printer, and a pen to write on the empty tracker. Stick it somewhere visible—like your fridge door—with simple fridge magnets 🧲(affiliate link)."

# How to use the Meds Tracker

👉 **1st** Download an empty tracker and print one for each treatment date.

👉 **2nd** Add the treatment date to the top left corner.

👉 **3rd** Add the medications prescribed by your vet to the first column.  
  **Example sheet**: Here, three different medications advised by the vet have been added (eye drop 1, eye drop 2, and tablet).

👉 **4th** Add where the medication goes under the column labelled **“Route”**.  
  **Example sheet**: We have “Right eye”, “Both eyes”, and “Mouth”.

👉 **5th** Add an empty circle (⚪) on the correct cell when the medication is due (based on what’s written on the label).  
  **Example sheet**: For “eye drop 1”, we imagined that the label says *‘three times daily’* so three circles have been added, 8 hours apart.  
  💡 *Tip: Add a recurring alarm to your mobile phone to remind you!*

👉 **6th** Colour in or tick (🔘) the circle after the medication has been administered to your pet.  
  📌 In busy households, you can also **add your initials** inside or next to the circle after giving medication—just like in hospitals when multiple people share treatment duties.  
  **Example sheet**: Medication has been marked as given until after noon.

👉 **7th** Start over the next day with a new empty tracker.

📌 The tracker has a 3-hour overlap each day (6am, 7am, 8am) to give you flexibility when transitioning to the next sheet.  
⚠️ *But remember: do not administer the medication twice!*
