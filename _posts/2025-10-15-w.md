# 🐾 The Pet Eye Guide – Very Soon Available in Print

We’re excited to announce the release of **_The Pet Eye Guide_**, a clear, practical, and beautifully illustrated book designed to help pet owners understand and care for their dog’s and cat’s eye health.  

Written by **Francisco Miguel Gómez Villasclaras**, a veterinary ophthalmologist with over 20 years of experience in the UK and Spain, this guide aims to bridge the gap between clinical knowledge and everyday pet care.

## 👁️ What the Book Is About

**The Pet Eye Guide** helps pet owners recognise early warning signs of eye disease — redness, discharge, cloudiness, or discomfort — and understand what they mean.  

You’ll learn:
- How your pet’s eyes work (and what makes them unique)  
- The key signs to watch for and how to describe them clearly to your vet  
- Common conditions every owner should recognise  
- What you can safely do at home, and when to seek help  
- How to take clear photos of your pet’s eyes for your vet  

It’s written in plain language, with plenty of illustrations and practical advice, making it equally useful for new pet owners, rescue volunteers, and students in veterinary or nursing training who want to understand the owner’s perspective.
